# Ukrainian lemmatizer plugin for ElasticSearch

The plugin provides a capability to search across documents, written in ukrainian, using words in different forms. 

## Principles

The thing is, it makes you able to index not the source's words but their lemmas (lemma – canonical form of word) and also perform a lookup using different forms of the same word which will return you what you're looking for. Needless to say, the magic is being done under the hood! No more doubts like: "What if I put this word in plural? Maybe it'll finally find something?".
Each term before settling in the storage will be passed through ```UkrainianAnalyzer``` which looks in ```UkrainianLemmatizer``` if it has a lemma for the term and, in case of success, this lemma must get into index. The same sequence of actions has the place when you start a lookup over documents stored using the analyzer: it will convert your search terms according to dictionary and return results if there is any match.

## Get plugin

**Note**: I won't release a build for ES 2.2.0 due to ugly [bug][permissions].

You always can get latest ready-to-go builds on the [Releases page][releases].
Download the zip-file with the corresponding version of ES supported and install it with:

### ES 1.7.+
```<path_to_es_bin_dir>/plugin --url <path_to_distribution>/elasticsearch-ukrainian-lemmatizer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip --install ukrainian-lemmatizer```

### ES 2.0.0-2.2.1
```<path_to_es_bin_dir>/plugin install <path_to_distribution>/elasticsearch-ukrainian-lemmatizer-<plugin_version>.zip```

## Build the plugin

Manual building of the plugin consists of only 4 steps:

### For ES version 1.7.+
 * Clone this repository
 * Get inside the root dir of cloned repo and run ```gradle release```
 * Find built artifact in ```build/distributions/```
 * Import it into your ES installation with ```<path_to_es_bin_dir>/plugin --url <path_to_distribution>/elasticsearch-ukrainian-lemmatizer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip --install ukrainian-lemmatizer```
 
**Example**: ```./plugin --url file:///home/mrgambal/projects/elasticsearch-ukrainian-lemmagen/build/distributions/elasticsearch-ukrainian-lemmatizer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip --install ukrainian-lemmatizer```

### For ES version 2.0.0-2.2.1
 * Clone this repository
 * Get inside the root dir of cloned repo and run ```gradle release```
 * Find built artifact in ```build/distributions/```
 * Import it into your ES installation with ```<path_to_es_bin_dir>/plugin install <path_to_distribution>/elasticsearch-ukrainian-lemmatizer-<plugin_version>.zip```
 
**Example**: ```./plugin install file:/home/tenshi/projects/elasticsearch-ukrainian-lemmagen/build/distributions/elasticsearch-ukrainian-lemmatizer-1.1.0.zip```


## Usage

Here are simple examples of plugin usage which rely on ES HTTP API.
First of all we need to create the index which must include our analyzer:

```bash
# Create index with settings
curl -XPUT "http://localhost:9200/ukrainian/" -d '
{
   "settings":{
      "index":{
         "analysis":{
            "analyzer":{
               "ukrainian":{
                  "type": "ukrainian"
               }
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
'
```

Then we create some simple mapping:

```bash
# Define mapping
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:9200/ukrainian/user/_mapping" -d '
{
   "user":{
      "_all":{
         "analyzer":"ukrainian"
      },
      "properties":{
         "test":{
            "type":"string",
            "analyzer":"ukrainian"
         }
      }
   }
}
'
```

And fill the index with sample data:

```bash
# Create Documents
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:9200/ukrainian/user/" -d '
{
   "test":"гусятам"
}'
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:9200/ukrainian/user/" -d '
{
   "test":"підострожує"
}'
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:9200/ukrainian/user/" -d '
{
   "test":"гусяти"
}'
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:9200/ukrainian/user/" -d '
{
   "test":"п’яничка"
}'
```

Having that done and filled this index with some data we may query it using the same analyzer:

```bash
# Search
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:9200/ukrainian/user/_search?pretty=true" -d '
{
   "query":{
      "match":{
         "_all": {
             "query": "гусятах",
             "analyzer": "ukrainian"
         }
      }
   }
}
'
```

And here is what you'll receive:

```json
{
    "took": 111,
    "timed_out": false,
    "_shards": {
        "total": 5,
        "successful": 5,
        "failed": 0
    },
    "hits": {
        "total": 2,
        "max_score": 1.0,
        "hits": [{
            "_index": "ukrainian",
            "_type": "user",
            "_id": "AU_mWjT6wMGwUI93ytgK",
            "_score": 1.0,
            "_source": {
                "test": "гусяти"
            }
        }, {
            "_index": "ukrainian",
            "_type": "user",
            "_id": "AU_mWicgwMGwUI93ytgI",
            "_score": 0.30685282,
            "_source": {
                "test": "гусятам"
            }
        }]
    }
}
```

**Notice** you may find this particular example in ```test.sh``` inside the repository: you may use it for testing of serviceability of the plugin after you install it.
